  # roadmap section
  roadmap_title: ZumCoin Roadmap
  roadmap_1: Hello Zum
  roadmap_2: ZumCoin was born <strong>December 9th, 2017</strong>.
  roadmap_3: In the beginning, we were command line only, compiled only for Linux, and got banned repeatedly from online forums for hosting flash ZUM giveaways.
  roadmap_4: GUI Wallets
  roadmap_5: "ZumCoin Community has been hard at work to bring us a diverse graphical experience, as well as refreshing the command line wallet also. From day one, we've been committed to making ZumCoin easier, and that starts with a good GUI. Take your pick of one of the following wallets:"
  roadmap_6: Market Partnerships
  roadmap_7: We pledged to have our ZumCoins being publicly trading by Q2 2018, and we have accomplished that goal in several markets.
  roadmap_8: Development Started, Q2 2018
  roadmap_9: Mobius, Fast Blocks No Sync
  roadmap_10: A big headache with proof of work is syncing a huge chain, and fast blocks don't usually help that issue. Our goal is producing faster blocks on a shorter chain. This is perhaps the most aggressive goal, and will require the most help to complete.
  roadmap_11: TBA
  roadmap_12: Karai, Simple Smart Contracts
  roadmap_13: Distributed, trustless networks have uses beyond currency. Karai is our goal for enabling distributed applications and networks beyond the main blockchain.
  roadmap_14: Payment Integration Services
  roadmap_15: Fun, Fast, & Easy ZumCoin Payment Integration Services For Developers, By Developers. Accepting ZumCoin in your application is easier than ever.
  roadmap_16: Launched Q1 2019
